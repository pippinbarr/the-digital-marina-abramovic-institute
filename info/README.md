# The Digital Marina Abramović Institute

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description
Open to the public! With a special Kickstarter backers-only Science exhibit! For Science!

The Digital Marina Abramovic Institute was made in collaboration with the [Marina Abramovic Institute](http://www.marinaabramovicinstitute.org/). It was written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/), using the [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com/) library. Sound effects were made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/) and the font is [Commodore 64 Pixelized](http://www.dafont.com/commodore-64-pixelized.font) by [Devin Cook](http://www.devincook.com/).

Note that the original .swf incorporated a .php script for recording player feedback. That's not functional now and I'm unsure of how that will impact the playability of the .swf should you try it out.
