At 640x480 there are 307200 pixels.

We have, say, around 3000 backers.

So that is approximately 100 pixels per brick.

Smallest brick I can imagine is 8x4=32 pixels.

But you need grout, so it's 10x6 pixels

So that's 60 pixels per brick minimum.

So say it gets up to 3500 backers, that's 60x3500=210000 pixels.

So still enough for a strip of ground to walk on for sure.

So actually it's doable? What the fuck? But where? Room after the reception?


But may need 10x6 = 80 pixels. With 3500 backers = 80x3500=280000 pixels, meaning there are 27200 pixels left, which is roughly 56 vertical pixels left? Or 42.5? which is either 14 or 10 game pixels in height. Which is getting a bit tight and oppressive :/
